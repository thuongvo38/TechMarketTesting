If you want to take a look at my UnitTest code you can access it step by step below:
  1. Find on top and you will see the search icon ( Go to file ) OR press Shift + T
  2. Paste this link into it: app/src/test/java/com/example/appbanhangonlinereal/activity
     
Or you can do it manually by clicking on each file according to each item below
* app >> src >> test >> java >> com >> example >> appbanhangonlinereal >> activity

**Thank you for looking. Have a nice day**
